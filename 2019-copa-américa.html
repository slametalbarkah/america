            The 2019 Copa América was the 46th edition of the Copa América, the international men's association football championship organized by South America's football ruling body CONMEBOL. It was held in Brazil and took place between 14 June and 7 July 2019 at 6 venues across the country. This was the first time since 1991 where no CONCACAF nation took part in the tournament.<br/><br/>Heading into the tournament, Chile were the two-time defending champions, having won the 2015 and 2016 editions of the tournament, but were eliminated by Peru in the semi-finals leading to the third place match against Argentina, which they also lost.<br/><br/>Host nation Brazil won their ninth title by defeating Peru 3–1 in the final. Argentina took third place by beating Chile 2–1 in the third-place match.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Host country ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Originally, the 2019 Copa América was to be hosted by Chile, while Brazil was due to host the 2015 Copa América, because CONMEBOL normally rotates tournament host nations in alphabetical order. However, because Brazil hosted the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and the 2016 Summer Olympics, Brazil decided against also hosting the 2015 Copa América. Brazil's and Chile's football federations agreed to swap their host nation order for the 2015 and 2019 championships, and CONMEBOL approved this agreement in 2012.<br/><br/>Starting in 2021 (originally scheduled for 2020), Copa América will be held in the same years as the UEFA European Championship.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Venues ==<br/><br/>On 14 June 2018, CBF Vice President Fernando Sarney announced that five cities would host the tournament: Salvador, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Belo Horizonte and Porto Alegre.
