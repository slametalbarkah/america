            Save America (founded on November 9, 2020) is a leadership political action committee founded and controlled by 45th President and 47th President Donald Trump. It has been Trump's primary fundraising and political spending arm since he left his first term in office. The PAC has spent more than $60 million on legal fees for the former president and his allies.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>President Donald Trump founded and controls the Save America leadership political action committee (leadership PAC). Save America was founded and registered with the Federal Election Commission on November 9, 2020, two days after the 2020 presidential election results were declared. Its treasurer is Bradley T. Crate, who had been Trump's campaign treasurer. It is located in Arlington, Virginia.<br/><br/>Save America has been Trump's primary fundraising and political spending arm since he left office. ABC News wrote that Trump and his allies "have consistently pushed supporters to donate to the PAC, often using false claims about the 2020 election and soliciting donations to rebuke the multiple investigations into the former president, his business dealings, and his actions on Jan. 6."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Trump has used the PAC to pay for his post-presidential rallies, travel, staff expenses, $21.6 million in legal bills (including those of Trump confidants and aides called to testify before the January 6 attack US House committee), and portraits of himself and the former first lady that will one day hang in the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery ($650,000).
