            The Race Across America, or RAAM, is an ultra-distance road cycling race held across the United States that started in 1982 as the Great American Bike Race. <br/><br/><br/><br/>RAAM is one of the longest annual endurance events in the world. All entrants must prove their abilities by competing in any of several qualifying events, completing a course within a specified time period.<br/><br/>Currently, RAAM is several hundred miles longer than the Tour de France, and the two races differ in many other aspects. The courses of both races have varied over the years. However, in the Race Across America, the direction has always been from the west coast to the east coast of the United States, approximately 3,000 miles (4,800 km), making it a transcontinental event. More importantly, the race has no stages, i.e., it is a nonstop event from start to finish, with the fastest competitors needing slightly over 7 days to complete the course. By contrast, the Tour de France features a different route each year (alternating between clockwise and counterclockwise circuits around France) and is about 2,300 miles long; the distance is divided into individual daily stages spread over the course of about 3 weeks including rest days and contested at much higher on-bike speeds.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The first incarnation of RAAM, The Great American Bike Race, was organized by John Marino in 1982.  There were four competitors: John Marino himself, John Howard, Michael Shermer, and Lon Haldeman.
