            Vaudeville (; French: [vodvil] ) is a theatrical genre of variety entertainment which began in France in the middle of the 19th century. A Vaudeville was originally a comedy without psychological or moral intentions, based on a comical situation: a dramatic composition or light poetry, interspersed with songs and dances. It became popular in the United States and Canada from the early 1880s until the early 1930s, while changing over time.<br/><br/>In some ways analogous to music hall from Victorian Britain, a typical North American vaudeville performance was made up of a series of separate, unrelated acts grouped together on a common bill. Types of acts have included popular and classical musicians, singers, dancers, comedians, trained animals, magicians, ventriloquists, strongmen, female and male impersonators, acrobats, clowns, illustrated songs, jugglers, one-act plays or scenes from plays, athletes, lecturing celebrities, minstrels, and films. A vaudeville performer is often referred to as a "vaudevillian".<br/><br/>Vaudeville developed from many sources, including the concert saloon, minstrelsy, freak shows, dime museums, and literary American burlesque. Called "the heart of American show business", Vaudeville was one of the most popular types of entertainment in North America for several decades.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Etymology ==<br/><br/>The origin of the term is obscure but often explained as being derived from the French expression voix de ville 'voice of the city'. A second hypothesis is that it comes from the 15th-century songs on satire by poet Olivier Basselin, "Vau de Vire".
