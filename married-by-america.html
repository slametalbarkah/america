            Married by America is an American reality television series broadcast by the Fox Broadcasting Company (Fox). The series premiered on March 3, 2003, and its eighth and final episode aired on April 14, 2003. American DJ Sean Valentine hosted the series. It was produced by the production company Rocket Science Laboratories (Joe Millionaire, Temptation Island).<br/><br/>In 2005, Married by America was one of several television programs cited in a class-action lawsuit filed by the Writers Guild of America concerning labor law violations.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Format ==<br/><br/>Five single people agreed to be paired up sight unseen with strangers chosen by America. The five newly minted couples met and got engaged on the spot. This was accomplished through family members and phone-in votes by TV viewers. The five couples were Matt and Cortez (a friendly if awkward man and an attractive/uninterested woman who later claimed she was attracted to "the abusers"), Jennifer and Xavier (cold, unfriendly blonde woman and low-key Frenchman model), Stephen and Denise (uncomfortable average guy and low self-esteem woman who liked him much more than he liked her), Jill and Kevin (NHL team hostess and Catholic "daddy's girl" and a former pro baseball player seeking a new career), and Billie Jean and Tony (party girl and general bro).<br/><br/>Next, the five couples were sequestered at Copper North Ranch for an engagement period.
