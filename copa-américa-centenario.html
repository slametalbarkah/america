            The Copa América Centenario (Portuguese: Copa América Centenário, French: Coupe Amérique Centennaire, English: Centennial Cup America; literally Centennial America Cup) was an international men's soccer tournament that was hosted by the United States in 2016. The competition was a celebration of the centennial of CONMEBOL and the Copa América, and was the first Copa América hosted outside South America.<br/><br/>The tournament was a commemorative version of Copa América (not the 45th edition). It was held as part of an agreement between CONMEBOL and CONCACAF as a special edition between the usual four-year cycle, and featured an expanded field of sixteen teams (an increase from the usual twelve), with all ten teams from CONMEBOL and six teams from CONCACAF. Despite the tournament being an official iteration of the Copa América, the winner did not receive an invitation to the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup due to the commemorative nature of the tournament, although eventual winner Chile had already qualified through its 2015 victory.<br/><br/>Chile became the fourth nation to win at least two consecutive titles in CONMEBOL tournaments, after Uruguay, Argentina, and Brazil. Argentina, meanwhile, lost its third consecutive final in a major tournament, following losses to Germany at the 2014 World Cup and Chile at the 2015 Copa América.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Planning ==<br/><br/>In February 2012, Alfredo Hawit, then Acting President of CONCACAF, announced that the competition was expected to take place in 2016, as a celebration of CONMEBOL's centennial.<br/><br/>CONMEBOL President Nicolás Leoz said, "Hopefully we can organize a big event, because we're 100 years old and we want to celebrate big."<br/><br/>The tournament was announced by CONMEBOL on October 24, 2012 and confirmed by CONCACAF on May 1, 2014.<br/><br/>On September 26, 2014, FIFA announced that the tournament had been added to the FIFA International Match Calendar, meaning that clubs had to release players called up to the competition.<br/><br/>The tournament occurred in June 2016, along with UEFA Euro 2016.
