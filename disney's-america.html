            Disney's America was a proposed Disney theme park in the early 1990s. A site was selected in Haymarket, Virginia, approximately five miles (8.0 km) from Manassas National Battlefield Park and 35 miles (56 km) west of Washington, D.C., accessible from Interstate 66. Disney's America would have consisted of nine distinctly-themed areas spanning 125–185 acres (51–75 ha), and it would have featured hotels, housing, a golf course, and nearly 2,000,000 square feet (190,000 m2) of retail and commercial development.<br/><br/>The $650-million project (equivalent to $1.21 billion in 2023) was announced on November 11, 1993. It would have been themed to the history of the United States, and it was scheduled to open in 1998. The project had initial support from various politicians and local officials, but it soon faced opposition from citizen's groups and historians who objected to Disney's planned portrayal of historical events, as well as the potential impact on nearby historic sites. It was cancelled in September 1994 following disappointing early results for Euro Disney (now Disneyland Paris), the death of Frank Wells, rising costs, and the prospect of reduced profits with the park being closed for four months each year.<br/><br/>When Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park, California, went on sale in 1997, discussions to buy the park and retheme it revived the concept. However, the Knott family refused to sell to Disney, citing concerns over Disney's plans, and the project failed to take off. Several of the proposed elements of Disney's America were incorporated into Disney's California Adventure, which opened in 2001.
