            The Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) is a political organization in the United States advocating democratic socialism, and the largest socialist organization in the country. Established in 1982, the DSA emerged from a merger of the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (DSOC) and the New American Movement (NAM). Its membership and influence has seen significant growth since the late 2010s.<br/><br/>The DSOC, founded in 1973, was an offshoot of the Socialist Party of America (SPA) aligned with the ideas of Michael Harrington, a prominent socialist activist and intellectual; the NAM, founded in 1971, was a New Left group and descendant of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). After their merger in 1982, the DSA supported grassroots movements and progressive elements in the Democratic Party. It was a minor political force until the 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns of Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-identified democratic socialist, after which its membership swelled from about 6,000 members in 2015 to more than 90,000 in 2021. Its growth has also been fueled by social movements such as Black Lives Matter, climate justice, and Gaza war protests. While not a political party, the DSA has increasingly engaged in electoral politics by endorsing candidates who align with its values, such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib, DSA members elected to Congress in 2018. It has a decentralized structure, with local chapters and a national leadership that is elected every two years at a convention of chapter delegates.<br/><br/>The DSA's political program is rooted in democratic socialism, a political philosophy that rejects both the capitalist system and authoritarian forms of socialism, instead advocating for a democratic society in which the means of production are controlled by workers and communities, with the transition to such a society occurring through democratic processes.
