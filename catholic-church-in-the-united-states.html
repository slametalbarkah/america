            The Catholic Church in the United States is part of the worldwide Catholic Church in communion with the pope. With 23 percent of the United States' population as of 2018, the Catholic Church is the country's second-largest religious grouping after Protestantism, and the country's largest single church if Protestantism is divided into separate denominations. In a 2020 Gallup poll, 25% of Americans said they were Catholic. The United States has the fourth-largest Catholic population in the world, after Brazil, Mexico, and the Philippines.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Catholicism has had a significant cultural, social, and political impact on the United States.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Early colonial period ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>One of the Thirteen Colonies of British America, the Province of Maryland, "a Catholic Proprietary", was founded with an explicitly English Catholic identity in the 17th century, contrasting itself with the neighboring  Protestant-dominated Massachusetts Bay Colony and Colony of Virginia. It was named after the Catholic Queen Henrietta Maria, the wife of Charles I of England. Politically, it was under the influence of Catholic colonial families of Maryland such as the Calvert Baron Baltimore and the Carroll family, the latter of Irish origin.<br/><br/>Much of the religious situation in the Thirteen Colonies reflected the sectarian divisions of the English Civil War. This predicament was especially precarious for Catholics.
