            The name of the Gulf of Mexico became a subject of dispute inside and outside the United States in 2025. U.S. president Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14172 on January 20, 2025, directing the U.S. interior secretary to change its name to the "Gulf of America" within the U.S. federal government. As of February 2025, the majority of Americans oppose the change, according to polling. The gulf has been known as the Gulf of Mexico since the 1550s, having derived its name from Mexica, the Nahuatl term for the Aztecs.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Amerigo Vespucci, along with other explorers, is credited with the first European exploration of the Gulf of Mexico and the Yucatán Channel between 1497 and 1498, navigated the Straits of Florida, and continued northward up to Chesapeake Bay before returning to Spain. It has been disputed, however, that the voyage actually took place.<br/><br/>For centuries, the Gulf of Mexico has been recognized by that name—derived from the term Mexica (the Nahuatl name for the Aztecs). It began to be used on early European maps in 1550, and the name soon became established in international cartography and legal usage by bodies such as the International Hydrographic Organization.<br/><br/>In 2006, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) received a proposal to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, and the Board on Geographic Names (BGN) unanimously decided not to approve it. The idea of renaming the gulf to the Gulf of America was suggested jokingly in 2010, when American comedian Stephen Colbert humorously suggested creating a "Gulf of America fund" to help fund the cleanup following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.
