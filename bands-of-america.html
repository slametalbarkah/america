            Bands of America (BOA) is a music education advocacy organization and promoter of high school marching band competitions in the United States. Established in 1975 as Marching Bands of America (MBA), founder Larry McCormick's goal was to provide educational opportunities for music students nationwide. McCormick organized the first annual Summer Workshop and Festival in 1976. Renamed Bands of America in 1984, the organization became an independent, tax-exempt entity in 1988. In 2006, Bands of America merged with the Music for All Foundation, a music education advocacy organization, becoming the flagship program of the combined organization. Bands of America has received numerous awards from IFEA.<br/><br/>Marching Bands of America / Bands of America has conducted high school marching band contests including a national competition -- called the "Grand National" championship -- in every year since 1976 (except 2020, when all previously announced BOA competitions, including the Grand National Championship, originally scheduled for November 12-14, were cancelled in response to the coronavirus pandemic.) Since 1980, these events are conducted between September and November, culminating in the Grand Nationals, which have been held since 1989 in Indianapolis, Indiana and since 2008 specifically at Lucas Oil Stadium. From 1980 to 1989, Bands of America also hosted an annual Summer National Championship.<br/><br/>Since 1975, Bands of America's various programs, services and events have served approximately 1.75 million music students. Approximately 450,000 spectators attend Bands of America championships every year. The adjudication manual and contest procedures utilized by Bands of America have been licensed to or adopted by other organizations.
