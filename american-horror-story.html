            American Horror Story (AHS) is an American horror anthology television series created by Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk for the cable network FX. The first installment in the American Story media franchise, seasons of AHS are mostly conceived as self-contained miniseries, following a different set of characters in a new setting within the same fictional universe (which the show occasionally utilizes for crossovers between seasons, and shares with episodic spin-off American Horror Stories), and a storyline with its own "beginning, middle, and end." Some plot elements of each season are loosely inspired by true events.<br/><br/>Many actors appear in more than one season, usually playing a new character though sometimes as a returning character. Evan Peters, Sarah Paulson, and Lily Rabe have returned most frequently, with each having appeared in nine seasons, followed by Frances Conroy and Denis O'Hare who both appear in eight; Emma Roberts, Billie Lourd, and Leslie Grossman appear in six, while other notable actors including Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates, Angela Bassett, Adina Porter, Finn Wittrock, and Jamie Brewer appear in five of the seasons.<br/><br/>The first season, Murder House, centers on a family in a haunted house. The second season, Asylum, follows the patients and staff of a criminally insane institution. The third season, Coven, focuses on a coven of witches and their enemies. The fourth season, Freak Show, centers on an American freak show troupe. The fifth season, Hotel, follows the staff and guests of a hotel inhabited by supernatural beings. The sixth season, Roanoke, focuses on a farmhouse haunted by the lost Roanoke colony. The seventh season, Cult, centers on a cult after the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
