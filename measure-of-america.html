            Measure of America is a non-partisan, non-profit initiative of the Social Science Research Council in Brooklyn, New York. It conducts research and analysis primarily on human development data from the United States at the national, state and county levels.<br/><br/>Measure of America aims to stimulate fact-based dialogue about human development issues in the United States by "breathing life into numbers, and using data to create compelling narratives that foster greater understanding of our shared challenges and greater support for people-centered policies."<br/><br/>Measure of America's seminal work is the American Human Development Index. Its U.S. specific index is based on human development concepts introduced by Mahbub ul Haq and Amartya Sen.<br/><br/>In partnership with foundations, non-profit organizations, government offices, and corporations, Measure of America has produced reports, interactive tools, and services focused on data analysis and data visualization.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== American Human Development Reports ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The American Human Development Report is a biennial report on human well-being in the United States produced by Measure of America. It follows the human development concept, which is the process of expanding the well-being of individuals to develop their full potential, by increasing opportunities in the arenas of health, education, and income. Similar to the global Human Development Report, published annually by the United Nations Development Programme, and the National Human Development Reports (NHDRs), the American Human Development Reports serve as advocacy tools to spur lively debates and mobilize support for action and change.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== The Measure of America, 2013–2014 ===<br/><br/>The Measure of America, 2013–2014 was co-authored by Sarah Burd-Sharps and Kristen Lewis. It is the third in the American Human Development Reports series and, like its predecessors, includes updated Index rankings while examining changes in well-being since 2000, as well as before and after the Great Recession.
