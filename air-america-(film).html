            Air America is a 1990 American action comedy film directed by Roger Spottiswoode and starring Mel Gibson and Robert Downey Jr. as Air America pilots flying missions in Laos during the Vietnam War. When the protagonists discover their aircraft is being used by government agents to smuggle heroin, they must avoid being framed as the drug-smugglers.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is adapted from Christopher Robbins' 1979 non-fiction book, chronicling the CIA-financed airline to transport weapons and supplies in Cambodia, Laos and South Vietnam during the Vietnam War.<br/><br/>The publicity for the film, advertised as a lighthearted buddy movie, implied a tone that differs greatly from the actual film, which includes such serious themes as an anti-war message, focus on the opium trade, and a negative portrayal of Royal Laotian General Vang Pao (played by actor Burt Kwouk as "General Lu Soong").<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Plot ==<br/><br/>In late 1969, helicopter pilot Billy Covington has his pilot's license suspended for breaking safety regulations. His skills, bravery and disregard for the law are noticed by a government agent, who offers him a job in Laos working for the "strictly civilian" company Air America, which turns out to be a front for CIA operations.<br/><br/>In Laos, he is introduced to Air America's unorthodox pilots and aircraft, being taken under the wing of pilot Gene Ryack, who uses official flights to buy black market weapons for his private cache. His retirement plan is to make enough money to afford quitting his Air America job.<br/><br/>Senator Davenport arrives to investigate rumors that Air America is transporting drugs for Laotian forces.
