            Asterix Conquers America (in France as Astérix et les Indiens; in Germany as Asterix in Amerika) is a 1994 German animated film, directed by Gerhard Hahn, and co-produced by Hahn and Jürgen Wohlrabe. The film is a loose adaptation of the Asterix graphic novel, Asterix and the Great Crossing, and the first film adaptation to be produced outside France. It is also the first Asterix movie to be made in English. The plot focuses on Asterix and Obelix seeking to rescue Getafix, who is transported to North America by the Romans, before their village runs out of magic potion to defend themselves.<br/><br/>The film was mainly made for the direct-to-video market, and was distributed in Germany by Jugendfilm, with 20th Century Fox handling distribution in several European territories, including France and the United Kingdom.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Plot ==<br/><br/>After the rebel village of Gauls defeat another Roman army, a humiliated Julius Caesar angrily devises a plan to cut them off from the magic potion that gives them super-human strength. Caesar's most loyal patrician, Lucullus, finds himself instructed to kidnap the druid Getafix and send him off the edge of the world. Meanwhile in Gaul, a freak accident during a fight amongst the villagers accidentally spills a cauldron of potion Getafix was making. Although there is a small amount left, Getafix is forced to locate ingredients to make more, with Dogmatix accompanying him. Taking advantage of this, Lucullus pretends to be a druid in order to entrap both.
