            Vanguard America is an American white supremacist, neo-Nazi, neo-fascist organization. The organization is also a member of the Nationalist Front. The group gained significant attention after it was revealed that James Alex Fields had marched with them at the Unite the Right rally before being arrested on murder charges. The group has its roots in the alt-right movement.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Vanguard America (VA) had no national presence or coverage until in 2016 when Dillon Irizarry gave a speech at a neo-Nazi gathering in Pikeville, Kentucky stating he was the leader of the group, and that they had 200 members in 20 states. Irizarry would go on to say that VA was founded in 2015 in California and that he wasn't the founder of the group, rather he took over leadership. Irizarry, who legally changed his name in 2006 to Dillon Hopper, is a Marine Corps veteran who had served in Afghanistan, also claimed that "many" members were veterans but active duty service members were barred from affiliating with the group until their contract had ended for their "safety". Hopper also states that local branches exist in Arizona, California, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and Washington. In July 2017, it also created a women's division.<br/><br/>In June of 2017 the group held a "Texas is Ours" rally in Austin, Texas and during the event the leader of the Texan branch, Thomas Rousseau, gave a lengthy speech and largely sidelined VA's leader Dillon Hopper.
