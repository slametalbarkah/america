            Voice of America (VOA or VoA) is an international broadcasting state media network funded by the federal government of the United States. It is the largest and oldest of the U.S. international broadcasters, producing digital, TV, and radio content in 48 languages for affiliate stations around the world. Its targeted and primary audience is non-Americans outside the US borders, especially those living in countries without press freedom or independent journalism.<br/><br/>VOA was established in 1942, during World War II. Building on American use of shortwave radio during the war, it initially served as an anti-propaganda tool against Axis misinformation but expanded to include other forms of content like American music programs for cultural diplomacy. During the Cold War, its operations expanded in an effort to fight communism and played a role in the decline of communism in several countries. Throughout its operations, it has aimed to broadcast uncensored information to residents under restrictive regimes, even airing behind the Iron Curtain. In response, some countries began investing in technology to jam VOA broadcasts. In post-Soviet Russia under Vladimir Putin, VOA was designated as a "foreign agent" and blocked alongside other western international broadcasters, but its programming still reaches Russian listeners through other means. <br/><br/>It is headquartered in Washington, D.C., and overseen by the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), an independent agency of the U.S. government funded with Congressional approval, which also oversees Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Funds are appropriated annually under the budget for embassies and consulates.
