            The 2021 Copa América was the 47th edition of the Copa América, the international men's football championship organised by South America's football ruling body CONMEBOL. The tournament took place in Brazil from 13 June to 10 July 2021. It was originally scheduled to take place from 12 June to 12 July 2020 in Argentina and Colombia as the 2020 Copa América. On 17 March 2020, CONMEBOL announced that due to the COVID-19 pandemic in South America, the tournament had been postponed for a year, in conjunction with UEFA's decision to also postpone UEFA Euro 2020 to 2021. This was the first time since 1991 where no guest nation took part in the tournament.<br/><br/>On 20 May 2021, Colombia was removed as co-host amid ongoing protests against President Iván Duque Márquez, and Argentina was then removed on 30 May due to COVID-19 issues. The following day CONMEBOL confirmed Brazil as the new host of the tournament.<br/><br/>Hosts Brazil were the title holders, having won their ninth title in 2019, which they also hosted. Argentina won their record-tying fifteenth title after defeating Brazil 1–0 in the final, marking the first time Brazil failed to win the competition on home soil. Argentina secured a first senior trophy since the 1993 edition of the same tournament, also equalling Uruguay's overall record of Copa América titles. The title qualified Argentina to play the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions in 2022 against Italy, winners of the UEFA Euro 2020.
