            Mountain America Stadium is an outdoor college football stadium in Tempe, Arizona, located on the campus of Arizona State University (ASU).  It is the home of the Arizona State Sun Devils football team of the Big 12 Conference. The stadium opened in 1958. The stadium's seating capacity as of 2018 is 53,599, reduced from a peak of 74,865 in 1989. <br/><br/>The stadium is officially named Home of the ASU Sun Devils. It was named Sun Devil Stadium until 2023. The natural grass playing surface within the stadium was named Frank Kush Field in 1996 in honor of the former coach of the team. The stadium underwent a five-year, $304-million renovation that was completed in August 2019. <br/><br/>The stadium has hosted two annual college football bowl games: the Fiesta Bowl from 1971 to 2006, and the Cactus Bowl from 2006 to 2015. The stadium was the home of the Phoenix/Arizona Cardinals of the National Football League (NFL) from 1988 through the 2005 season, when the Cardinals moved into their own stadium in Glendale.
