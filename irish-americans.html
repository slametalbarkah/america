            Irish Americans (Irish: Gael-Mheiriceánaigh) is a term that refers to both Irish immigrants living within in the United States as well as Americans with Irish ancestry, whether full or partial.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Irish immigration to the United States ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== From the 17th century to the mid-19th century ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>Some of the first Irish people to travel to the New World did so as members of the Spanish garrison in Florida during the 1560s. Small numbers of Irish colonists were involved in efforts to establish colonies in the Amazon region, in Newfoundland, and in Virginia between 1604 and the 1630s. According to historian Donald Akenson, there were "few if any" Irish forcibly transported to the Americas during this period.<br/><br/>Irish immigration to the Americas was the result of a series of complex causes. The Tudor conquest and subsequent colonization by English and Scots people during the 16th and 17th centuries had led to widespread social upheaval in Ireland. Many Irish people tried to seek a better life elsewhere.<br/><br/>At the time European colonies were being founded in the Americas, offering destinations for emigration. Most Irish immigrants to the Americas traveled as indentured servants, with their passage paid for a wealthier person to whom they owed labor for a period of time. Some were merchants and landowners, who served as key players in a variety of different mercantile and colonizing enterprises.
