            SS America was an ocean liner and cruise ship built in the United States in 1940 for the United States Lines and designed by the noted American naval architect William Francis Gibbs. It carried many names in the 54 years between its construction and its 1994 wreck: SS America (carrying this name three different times during its career); troop transport USS West Point; and SS Australis, Italis, Noga, Alferdoss, and American Star. It served most notably in passenger service as America and the Greek-flagged Australis.<br/><br/>Sold with the intention of being refitted to become a hotel ship, while being towed to Thailand she was wrecked as American Star at Playa de Garcey on Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands on 18 January 1994. The wreck deteriorated and completely collapsed into the sea. By 2024 it was no longer visible on the ocean surface and had become an artificial reef.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Construction (1936–1940) ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>America was laid down under the first Maritime Commission contract on 22 August 1938 at Newport News, Virginia by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company.<br/><br/>It was one of only a few ocean liners, American or otherwise, to have had its interiors designed by women—the New York firm Smyth, Urquhart &amp; Marckwald. The ornate decor typical of liners of the past was forgone, in favor of a more contemporary and informal design.<br/><br/>The aim was to provide an atmosphere of cheerfulness and sophisticated charm.
