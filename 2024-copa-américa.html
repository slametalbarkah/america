            The 2024 Copa América was the 48th edition of the Copa América, the quadrennial international men's soccer championship organized by South America's football ruling body CONMEBOL. The tournament was held in the United States from June 20 to July 14, 2024, and was co-organized by CONCACAF.<br/><br/>This was the second time that the United States hosted the tournament, having hosted the Copa América Centenario in 2016. Argentina was the defending champion, and won a record sixteenth title after defeating Colombia 1–0 after extra time in the final, which was played on July 14, 2024, at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Host selection ==<br/><br/>The 2024 Copa América had been expected to be hosted by Ecuador because of CONMEBOL's host rotation order. However, it was run by America because CONMEBOL president Alejandro Domínguez said Ecuador had been nominated but not yet chosen to organize the edition. In November 2022, the country declined to host the tournament. Peru and the United States had both expressed interest in organizing the tournament.<br/><br/>On January 27, 2023, it was announced that, as part of CONCACAF and CONMEBOL's new strategic partnership, the United States would host the tournament with six CONCACAF guest teams qualifying through the 2023–24 CONCACAF Nations League. The tournament also acted as a prelude to the 2026 FIFA World Cup, of which the United States is a joint host along with Canada and Mexico.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Venues ==<br/><br/>All of the stadiums were existing venues. The opening match was held at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia, while the final was held at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.
